That's the line up."<P>"We have been told that the project is reminscent of AntiRom, a multimedia CD-ROM made by artists from University of Westminster, Harrow. That's good as AntiRom is one of the few CD's that really engages with the media. The difference is that we're a band, a music based outfit, and the CD reflects this and engages its audience in music."<P>"We have put three tracks together that you can play on any CD player. As we use computers to compose and record with, we have taken some of the components and used them to create arrangment tools and games."<P>"We are not into reinventing the wheel so we haven't emulated the mixing desk but created a new graphical environment that's fun and addresses multimedia as a new media rather than misappropriating other media that works far more efficiently in its own right." As Brian Eno says:<H4>"Why watch TV on the Net or CD-ROM at 3 frames per second when you can watch it on TV?"</H4><A HREF="plin.html"><FONT SIZE=-1>Press Directory</FONT></A>   </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
