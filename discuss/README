This version isunsupported, however the copyright still belongs to GlobalMedia Designand the same restrictions apply as for the complete Hyperthread version.You may use this software as long as you like however you may not make anymodifications aside from editing the radthread-headers.pl file forconfiguring the system. Copying and redistribution is strictly prohibited.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-System Requirements:--------------------The Hyperthread and Hyperthread-Lite software packages were designedand tested on the following Unix systems:Linux (kernel versions 1.2.9, 1.2.13)BSDI (kernel version #2)Solaris/SunOSIrixThese packages should work on any flavor of Unix. If you use a platformother than those listed above please contact icculus@radzone.org withthe details so we may add it to the list!You must have Perl installed, any version from 4.036 on should work fine! You must have DBM support for your Perl installation. This means you mightneed to specifically require the DBM package you wish to use. There is one line in the radthread-headers.pl file which is commented out. If you are having problems with your DBM files try uncommenting it! The line looks like:#require 'NDBM_File.pm';-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-Installation Instructions:--------------------------I. Determine where your Perl executable is and make sure the front-endscripts are pointing to this location. The following files will need tohave the proper perl location:change_admin.plhyper.cgihyper-admin.cgihyper-init.plIf you are unsure how to find your perl executable use the 'which perl'command from your Unix prompt.II. Make a subdirectory somewhere in your web documents directory and copyall of the files located in your 'images' directory. This directory containsall of the images needed by the system as well as the Hyperthread onlinehelp document. Make sure the directory you place these files in is readableby your web server!III. There is only one file which you need to edit to configure the Hyperthreadsystem, radthread-headers.pl . This file contains global definitions for thesystem and is broken down into two sections, 1) the definitions you need toedit and 2) those which you should leave alone. In particular you need tospecify 4 definitions:$image_base_url - The base url for your Hyperthread images directory (the                  directory you create to store the image files and help doc).		  Do not leave a trailing slash, the system takes care of this.$image_base_dir - The full pathname of the Hyperthread images directory. Again,                  do not leave a trailing slash.$cgi_base_url -   The base url for the Hyperthread cgi directory (the directory                  you installed the Hyperthread into). As with the images base		  url, do not leave a trailing slash.$cgi_base_dir -   The full pathname of the Hyperthread cgi directory.The rest of the global definitions are specified in the same file, there is no need to change anything.IV. Run the hyper-init.pl script. This will initialize the DBM databasesthat the system uses, add an entry for the administrator's userid and password(so you may login to the hyper-admin.cgi system) and create a welcome message.V. Make sure the DBM databases are writable by the web server! The hyper-init.plscript will create these DBM files but chances are your web server will not beable to write to them due to write permissions set when the files are created.The down and dirty way to ensure these files are writable is to make themworld writable, do this as follows:Make sure you are in the Hyperthread cgi-bin directoryAt the prompt type:chmod 777 dbchmod 666 db/*Your Hyperthread-Lite should be all ready for use! The userid and passwordfor access to the administration panel were displayed when you ran thehyper-init.pl script, make sure you write these down! You may also usethe change_admin.pl script to change the administrator userid and passwordwhenever you like! The syntax is:change_admin.pl <userid> <password>If you are happy with this product and would like more information aboutthe complete Hyperthread 2.0 version contact GlobalMedia Design Inc. atgmd@radzone.org.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-
