Festivalnouveaux de cinema et nouveaux  medias.<br><br></td></tr><tr><td><br><br>This performance uses  media such as CUSeeMe, Live internet chat, liveFTP (to allow a remote audience to upload images sounds and text) ,preauthored images, video together with live audio as a means tocreate a live media  'Jam' or improvisation. The musical term Jam isused to describe a number of musicians improvising together aroundspecific keys and passages or themes. In this performance the idea ofthemes and keys are related to content in the form of concepts. Thedisparate medias are placed together in one large screen space wherethe participnats on line or at the venue are able to create textimages and video that corresponds to each other. This at one end ofthe scale can produce  vibrant forms of narrative. Equally it canproduce chaotic data. AudioRom respond during theperformance to provide a binding scape of audio in conjunction withthe remote visual content.<br><br> </td></tr><tr><td><IMG SRC="../images/mont7.jpg"></td></tr></table></BODY></HTML>
