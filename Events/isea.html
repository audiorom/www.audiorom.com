AudioRom together with AntiROM and Header are billedto perform two nights in Rotterdam for DEAF and then give a conference onInteractive music as part of ISEA.<p>We arrive after the long crossing at our luxury hotel, booked in advance by thefestival organisers. Paul and Chris have the funky room of course, consisting oftwo hospital beds designed for vertically challenged persons with arched backs. Awardrobe with a door missing, tastefully decorated with that mould and damp look,complete with South London Posse graffiti, just in case you feel home sick. The on-suite shower, located down the hall had that special ambience of the executionchamber. Of course we hit the nearest coffee shop to achieve a numbing effect and we did, infact most of the time we were there. (1st lessonalways insist on the Holiday Inn!)<p>After a night of induced sleep we arrive at the venue at the planned time of 10am DEAF time. The four Apple Macs, Six Barco Projectors and PA Rig must be somewhere else in Rotterdam, what says it&#39;s time for another coffee. 2pm, 2 of theMacs show up and none of our interfaces will run on them. (2nd lesson, alwaysimport you own Macs) We attempt to install our relevant MIDI and AV system stuffon System 0.1, could we read Dutch, no!. By the time wecompletely re-install the System software the rest of the kit shows up and wemanage to set up.<P><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=10%><TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=MIDDLE><IMG SRC="../images/screen.gif"><P><B><FONT COLOR="#BA55D3" SIZE=-2>The large 360 dome projection screen, which hung directly above the dance floor, at the club.</FONT></B></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>We used 3 Interactive Systems for this gig:<p>A laser and sensor system that generates MIDI and Switch events to the Macs, Thisin turn triggers graphics and samples that synchronise to the music.<p>A video system that captures video loops, we are then able to input pixellocations on the screen or projection, so that when the audience passes in frontof those locations, audio is triggered. The video loop causes the audio to performin a looped format .<p>For this event we worked closely with Jamie (our DJ) to generate visuals thatwould sync with the set. Using the source from his decks we processed  the signalusing a stereo noise gate so that a bass drum and snare would trigger graphics.<p>The gig itself was fine and all the systems performed well. The projectionsystem comprising of six Barco&#39;s projecting on a polygon dome and split videowalls, looked great and created a sense of visual immersion for the visualcontent, In fact there was more kit than crew. The significant let down was thatthere was more crew than audience.<p>The next day Andy from AntiRom went to pick up our passes from the festivalorganiser for the rest of ISEA or is it DEAF, well actually it&#39;s DUMB. The DEAForganisers knew nothing of our presence in Rotterdam and informed us that wemust have been invited by the breakaway group involved in DEAF that set up analternative festival called DUMB. The lack of hotel, audience and organisationsuddenly made sense.<p>We never found out what DUMB stood for, probably Dutch Unattended Multimedia Bollocks.......<P><A HREF="therm.html"><FONT SIZE=-1>Events Directory</FONT></A></TD></TR></TABLE><p></BODY></HTML>
