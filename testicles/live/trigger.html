Viewers areessentially choosing their own tracks and sequencing them live into thesystem using a similar approach to a DJ / VJ.<BR><BR>Trigger Happy will be shown in <A HREF="../news/berlin.html">Berlin</A> at Kunst+Technik in September.<BR><BR><A HREF="installations.html"><IMG SRC="../images/back.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A> </FONT></TD>  	<TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=BOTTOM><IMG SRC="../images/trigger.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="210" BORDER="0"></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
