The computer installations consist of 2 originally designed interactive interfaces which resembles and represents a combination of a linear rail track and a musical score. Hundreds of iconographic thumb prints designed from industrial and electronic images will act as representations of orchestral and electronic passages which the Audience will be able to audition and then place on the track or score. <p>All of the interfaces are networked so that the user will see real time responses and interactions from other users / remote users. This also enables the arrangement of the score to be a remote shared experience and also constantly updates the musical / sonic status of the overall arrangement<p>A small data base programmed from the contents of the train time table connects to a play head / visual representation of the train on the track /score time line. At designated times this representation will move in a linear fashion across the time line according to the position of the train determined by the time table. As the representation of the train collides with the placed iconography, the chosen sounds are triggered and hence performs the composition / arrangement made by the audience.<p>The performances will be broadcast live via real audio and at the installations on the station. Over the period of the festival it is perceived that the arrangements will develop over time creating a rich sonic composition. <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br>Sound Track<br>AudioRom<br>ISEA 98 (International Symposium of Electronic Art)<br>2 - 7 September<p>Sound Track takes the work of AudioRom out of the gallery and music arena<br>and into a site specific public art context. Using the train line between<br>Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly as its source, Sound Track<br>looks at the history of the impact of the rail network on society as a<br>parallel with today's digital network and the electronic revolution. This<br>is an extension of AudioRom's characteristic fusion of sound and visuals as<br>the artists continue to place themselves as one of the most innovative<br>collectives working on this type of synergy. Placing the emphasis firmly on<br>the sonic in the case of Sound Track, visuals will be drawn from railway<br>archives and time tabling information in order to create a new form of<br>musical notation.<p>The artists will mix archive sound and other sampled pieces with rich<br>orchestral composition put together with Instrumental. The audience will<br>be able to make up their own compositions from the visuals which represent<br>different sounds and sequences, with the train line between Liverpool and<br>Manchester acting as the linearity of the musical score. Each score will<br>last approximately 1 hour (the duration of the train journey) and will<br>be linked to the train timetable.<p>Compositions can be made at Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly <br>using purpose built consoles. The audience will then  be able to hear some or all <br>of their composition broadcast via Real Audio and live at the stations. The train <br>becomes the cursor and  is a guide to triggering the sound as it progresses on <br>its journey.<p>Sound Track is proof that old and new technologies can co-exist in a<br>creative context. Digital and analogue are not mutually exclusive and can<br>be made to interact together just as people interact with the computer<br>interface. Using the rail network which dates back 150 years, radio, and<br>the digital combined with traditional and experimental sound, Sound Track<br>will provide a complex, sumptuous and ultimately hedonistic critique of the<br>different social revolutions which have taken place over the last two<br>centuries.<p>--------------------------------------<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>International Symposium on Electronic Art 98<p>ISEA, the annual International Symposium on Electronic Art is the foremost event of<br>its kind in the world.  isea98, the ninth symposium, has been organised as<br>a partnership between the Foundation for Art & Creative Technology (FACT),<br>Liverpool John Moores University and Manchester Metropolitan University.<p>revolution98 is the largest and most ambitious programme of electronic arts<br>projects ever staged in Britain.   It takes place simultaneously in<br>Liverpool and Manchester and can be found in galleries, theatres, bars,<br>clubs, trains and on the internet.  Together,  the commissions of new work,<br>exhibitions, performances and events ask just one simple question: How much<br>has technology changed the rules?<p>The programme explores the effect of the so-called 'technological<br>revolution' on art, culture and society through the work of artists,<br>musicians, computer programmers and others and considers what's become of<br>the idea of 'REVOLUTION' at the end of the century.<p>All this is explored, questioned and celebrated in more than 100 diverse<br>projects by artists from 29 different countries.<p><br>For five weeks in September and October the cities of Liverpool and<br>Manchester play host to one of the most prestigious events in the global<br>electronic arts calendar.  isea98 is both a major international symposium<br>for experts and activists in the diverse fields of electronic media and a<br>large-scale exhibition and events programme showcasing some of the most<br>fascinating and challenging work by artists using electronic and digital<br>media today.<p>The theme set by the collaborators of isea98 is 'revolution' and will be<br>explored critically, culturally and politically through both the six day<br>symposium and five week exhibition and events programme.  Together,  the<br>commissions of new work, exhibitions, performances and events ask just one<br>simple question: How much has technology changed the rules?<p>The Foundation for Art & Creative Technology (FACT) is Britain's leading<br>agency for the commissioning of new work in video and electronic media.<br>For isea98  it has organised the largest programme of electronic art ever<br>presented in Britain - revolution98 - which can be found in galleries,<br>theatres, bars, clubs, trains and on the internet.   Ranging from computer<br>and video-based interactive works, to publicly-sited sound projects,<br>performances and club events, isea98 will feature world premieres of new<br>work by acclaimed artists John & Paul Butler (UK), Gina Czarnecki (UK),<br>Willie Doherty (Ire), Judith Goddard (Uk), Perry Hoberman (US), Kristin<br>Lucas (US), Andrea Zapp (Ger), Keith Piper (UK), Elizia Volkmann (UK),<br>amongst many others.<p>We are delighted to announce Bulgarian artist Nedko Solakov's first<br>solo-staged exhibition in Britain as part of isea98 along with the first<br>isea artist's residency awarded to Beijing-based artist Feng Mengbo who<br>will create new work in Liverpool throughout August.<p>Specially commissioned sound works and performances are being created by<br>international sound and vision masters AudioRom (UK), Scanner (UK) and<br>Granular Synthesis (Austria) for England's leading nightclub Cream,<br>alongside publicly sited interventions by Cornford & Cross (UK), Nigel<br>Helyer (Aus) and Mäkelä & Paasonen (Fin).<br></blockquote><br><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 45--></ul><!--end: 45--><br><H4><a name="postfp">Post a Followup</a></H4><form method=POST action="http://www.audiorom.com/cgi-bin/multi4M.cgi"><input type=hidden name="reply" value="45"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="AudioRom Sound Track ISEA 98"><input type=hidden name="origemail" value="studio@audiorom.com"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Liverpool Lime street and Manchester Picadilly station 3rd to the 6th September"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="August 29, 1998 at 11:2:32"><input type=hidden name="bb_id" value="soundings::Soundings"><input type=hidden name="allowTags" value=""><pre>Name:     <input type=text name="name" size=41>E-Mail:   <input type=text name="email" size=41><p>Subject:  <input type=text name="subject" value="Re: Liverpool Lime street and Manchester Picadilly station 3rd to the 6th September" size=41><p>Message:<br><textarea name="body" COLS=40 ROWS=10></textarea><p align="center"><input type=submit value="Submit Follow Up"> <input type=reset value="Clear"></p><hr size=4 width="75%"><p align="center">[ <a href="msg/45.html#followups">Follow Ups</a> ] [ <a href="msg/45.html#postfp">Post Followup</a> ] [ <a href="index.html">Soundings</a> ] </p><hr size=4 width="75%"><p></body></html>
