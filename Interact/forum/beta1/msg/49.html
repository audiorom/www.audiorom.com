FREEFORM:<p>- 30 sec delay  to get to freeform (without sound)<br>- white pixel accumalation in first line of window (look like a sound pattern)<br>- "trash" dialogue box looks very unusual<br>- could not get the "load text" dialogue to work, even after renaming a "ReadMe" file to "Audioromtxt"<p>b. ARRANGER1<p>- 30 sec delay from index (no sound). 2nd time it took only about 10 sec. which goes for the other toys too (maybe cache thing, or a thing of director having to load all the members first)<br>- when dragging pieces to the bottom window, they don't always disappear. Some get stuck in between the originals. This is not a problem when dragging the pieces to the top and releasing them there, where they dissappear.<p>c. ARRANGER2<p>- 30 sec delay with sound, then sound cuts off as index fades to black.<br>- same problem of sticky pieces, when dropped to bottom as in Arr.1<p>d. KEYS (....love it !)<p>- 30 sec delay with sound till toy appears<br>- seems to work alright apart from one occasion, where pressing "w" crashed it with a stuck sound.<br>- (why does the play button change, when clicked?)<p>e. MIXER BOUNCE<p>- 30 sec delay, no sound<br>- pressing stop initiates script error, and makes sound start without clicking in the window<br>- big circle has a lot of noise (specially on one channel)<br>- clicking stop, when the middle sized one is playing, takes 20 sec to reset.<br>- script error after clicking stop, when the small one was palying<br>- rings appear outside toy window along the screens edge - 10 pix bottom, 50 pix top, 30 pix left. Does not cause any problems<p>f. MIXER STATIC<p>- 30 sec delay without sound<br>- all forms get stuck in colour bar at top at times, don't seem to be a certain pattern<br>- colour does not appear to have any effect on the sound (pure visual non-sans!?!)<br>- 30 sec delay when going back to index, then index stopped for twice before being usuable again<p>g. PAINTER<p>- strange dialogue box<br>- dodgy painting reliability, specially on the edges of the screen, also when drawing long lines<br>- "help screen" erases image underneath its area<br>- what does the painting do?<p>h. PANTS1<p>- 30 sec delay with index image, no sound<br>- bottom button (with colour) stuck, no response apart from flickering<br>- no sound on centre "bounce circle" and the centre vertical ine<br>- nice that the vertical bar allow rings to travel through horizontal one, when placed along path<br>- immediate return to index !<p>i. PANTS2<p>- 30 sec delay with index, then black and warning sound when toy appears<br>- 15 sec delay when going back to index<p>j. POETRY GENERATOR<p>- 30 sec delay no sound<br>- call me German but I don't quite understand this one, seems to work alright, can safe from it, but how about loading an already safed one?<br>- slow when going back to index<p>k. PONG<p>- 30 sec delay, no sound<br>- very jagged movement of balls (not smooth)<br>- if impact angle is small (below 20 degree something) balls get through anyway<br>- sometimes stops counting and movement of balls (together)<p>l. SLIDER<p>- 20 sec delay with sound and index, then black 4 ten<p>m. TPOWER1<p>- 30 sec delay with sound in index<br>- 15 sec delay on return to index without sound<p>n. TPOWER 2<p>- 30 sec delay with sound but black screen<p>I hope to manage to get some of the screnn shots attached ; the dialogue box and script error, but as I'm sending this from PC I'm not sure whether this will happen.<p>It would make sense perhaps to swop the "load" and "save" icons around; I constantly tried to save it, only to be presented with an open dialogue box (e.g. up from the hardisk = load, down to the hardisk = save....)<br> <p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p></blockquote><br><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 49--><!--top: 50--><li><a href="msg/50.html">Re: thx olli</a> <b>simon</b> <i>1/28/98 18:48:58</i>(<!--responses: 50-->0)<ul><!--insert: 50--></ul><!--end: 50--></ul><!--end: 49--><br><H4><a name="postfp">Post a Followup</a></H4><form method=POST action="http://www.audiorom.com/cgi-bin/multi4M.cgi"><input type=hidden name="reply" value="49"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Olli"><input type=hidden name="origemail" value="kcglc@wmin.ac.uk"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Beta 0.1c test report"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="January 28, 1998 at 13:36:54"><input type=hidden name="bb_id" value="beta1::Beta"><input type=hidden name="allowTags" value=""><pre>Name:     <input type=text name="name" size=41>E-Mail:   <input type=text name="email" size=41><p>Subject:  <input type=text name="subject" value="Re: Beta 0.1c test report" size=41><p>Message:<br><textarea name="body" COLS=40 ROWS=10></textarea><p align="center"><input type=submit value="Submit Follow Up"> <input type=reset value="Clear"></p><hr size=4 width="75%"><p align="center">[ <a href="msg/49.html#followups">Follow Ups</a> ] [ <a href="msg/49.html#postfp">Post Followup</a> ] [ <a href="index.html">Beta</a> ] </p><hr size=4 width="75%"><p></body></html>
