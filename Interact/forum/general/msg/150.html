Beaudoin" <br>    To: <br>        <p><br>HONESTY PAYS BIG -- NO SCAM! <p>***TURN SIX DOLLARS INTO SIX THOUSAND QUICK AND EASY*** <p>HOW TO TURN SIX DOLLARS INTO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS READING THIS<br>COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE! IT DOES WORK! I found this on a bulletin board and decided<br>to try it. Alittle while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came<br>across an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only<br>an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, "Yeah right, this must be a scam", but like most of us, I<br>was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and<br>address stated in the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at<br>#6. Post the article (with your name in the #6 spot) in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are<br>thousands). No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I<br>thought about trying it. I figured: "what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, right?" Then I<br>invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!? Within 7 days, I started getting money in the<br>mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first<br>week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000.00!<br>In the third week I had over $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I<br>have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00,<br>and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on lunch!! Let me tell you how this works and most<br>importantly, WHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get<br>the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that<br>you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! <p>Suggestion: READ THIS ENTIRE MESSAGE CAREFULLY!! Print it out or download it. Follow<br>the simple directions and watch the money come in! <p>It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage) <p>IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and, it's 99% risk-free. Best of<br>all-- it really works! <p>If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends. <p>PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in<br>20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the<br>participants. PLEASE CONTINUE IN ITS SUCCESS BY CAREFULLY ADHERING TO THE<br>INSTRUCTIONS. <p>You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not solid and<br>tangible, it's a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations<br>are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from the mailing lists is<br>secondary to the income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that<br>list. Here are the 4 easy steps to success: <p>STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper "PLEASE<br>PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH<br>of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next,<br>place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 sealed<br>envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a<br>$1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are<br>requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a<br>little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office<br>(1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following<br>addresses: <p><p>#1) Wit Wichaidit <p>10912 Broad Green Terrace <p>Potomac, MD 20854 <p>#2) Mike Schude <p>893 S. Roanoke <p>Gilbert, AZ 85296 <p>#3) David Freeman <p>11045 Harbour Springs Circle <p>Boca Raton, Fl 33428 <p>#4) T. Shelp <p>7513 Redcliff Road <p>Indianapolis, IN 46256 <p>#5) Tim Beaudoin<p>5362 Greenplain Road<p>Norfolk, VA 23502 <br>#6 C.Lewis<p>1152 Foraker Rd <p>cinti oh 45206<p>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other names up (6<br>becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR name as #6 on the list. <p>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original as possible.<br>Now, post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000<br>groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! You<br>won't get very much unless you post like crazy. :) This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts,<br>refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for<br>yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, and again. PLEASE REMEMBER<br>that this program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by<br>their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way: if you are of integrity and honesty, the<br>program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way.<br>NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard<br>copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service.<br>(Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So,<br>as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be reimbursed<br>for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list<br>geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of<br>dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 - $1.00 for each of the first six people listed<br>above. Send it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business! <p>---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ <p>Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor<br>at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy'<br>from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory. <p>Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the<br>'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your<br>name to the list. Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings in<br>different settings, you'll always have this file to go back to. <p>Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet Explorer and try searching for various newsgroups (on-line<br>forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) <p>Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text of<br>this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that<br>everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message<br>button. You're done with your first one! Congratulations!!! THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump<br>to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for<br>each newsgroup! <p>**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU<br>WILL MAKE! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** <p>That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You may eventually<br>want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay<br>anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE<br>SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent<br>me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons<br>respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200<br>MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional<br>$125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3<br>and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $625.00! OK, now here is the fun part,<br>each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only<br>receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message<br>to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will<br>receive $15,625,00! With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no<br>longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to<br>names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to<br>remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and<br>reading these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if<br>it really works?? I think so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you<br>the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest<br>users and new honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing<br>to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those<br>joining the actual internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work. <p>WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND!!! GOD BLESS!<br></blockquote><br><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 150--></ul><!--end: 150--><br><H4><a name="postfp">Post a Followup</a></H4><form method=POST action="http://www.audiorom.com/cgi-bin/multi4M.cgi"><input type=hidden name="reply" value="150"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Gillberg"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="making money"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="October 1, 1999 at 22:14:30"><input type=hidden name="bb_id" value="general::General"><input type=hidden name="allowTags" value=""><pre>Name:     <input type=text name="name" size=41>E-Mail:   <input type=text name="email" size=41><p>Subject:  <input type=text name="subject" value="Re: making money" size=41><p>Message:<br><textarea name="body" COLS=40 ROWS=10></textarea><p align="center"><input type=submit value="Submit Follow Up"> <input type=reset value="Clear"></p><hr size=1 width="75%"><p align="center">[ <a href="msg/150.html#followups">Follow Ups</a> ] [ <a href="msg/150.html#postfp">Post Followup</a> ] [ <a href="index.html">General</a> ] </p><hr size=1 width="75%"><p></body></html>
