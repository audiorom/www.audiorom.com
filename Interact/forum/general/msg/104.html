Hollingsworth on April 19, 1998 at 20:51:28:<p>Dear Friend:<br>With a couple of minutes of your time I'm going to show you<br>how you can turn $6 and 6 stamps into thousands of dollars. Don't<br>get skeptical yet, just read the letter and then decide if you want<br>to invest a lousy $6!!<p><br>HOW TO TURN SIX DOLLARS INTO SIX THOUSAND:<p>: READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE! IT DOES WORK!<p>: I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little <br>: while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, <br>: and came across an article similar to this that said you could make <br>: thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of <br>: $6.00! So I thought, "Yeah right, this must be a scam", but <br>: like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said <br>: that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address stated in the <br>: article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of <br>: the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. <br>: (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it <br>: over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I <br>: figured: "what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, <br>: right?" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... <br>: within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I <br>: figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my <br>: first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had <br>: made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over <br>: $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I <br>: have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in <br>: rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more <br>: than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most <br>: importantly, WHY it works... Also, make sure you print a copy of this <br>: article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. <br>: I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you <br>: will start making more money than you thought possible by doing <br>: something so easy!<p>: Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or <br>: download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come <br>: in! <p>: It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus <br>: postage)<p>: IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not <br>: illegal; and it is 99% no risk - it really works!<p>: If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive <br>: extraordinary dividends.<p>: PLEASE NOTE: <br>: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be <br>: yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of <br>: the honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue its <br>: success by carefully adhering to the instructions. <p>: You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business <br>: your product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in <br>: the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are <br>: happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made <br>: from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from <br>: people like you and me asking to be included in that list.<p>: Here are the 4 easy steps to success:<p>: STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on <br>: each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now <br>: get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of <br>: paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent <br>: thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal <br>: them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of <br>: paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 <br>: bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY <br>: LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for <br>: it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried <br>: about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. <br>: Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed <br>: legal. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses: <br>#1) Mike Schude<br>: 893 S. roanoke<br>: Gilbert, AZ 85296<p>: 2) Tim Wahlstrom<br>2003-223 Bayview Hts. Dr.<br>San Diego, CA 92105<p>: #3) Peggy Williamson<br>330 E. 32nd St.<br>Ada, Ok 74820<p>: #4) Frank Stevens<br>P.O. Box 264<br>Tupelo, Ok 74572<p>: #5) Jason Williamson<br>202 Park Dr.<br>Ada, Ok 7482<p>: #6) Dennis E. Ribble<br>RR3 BOX 32-1B<br>Benton, PA 17814<p><br>: STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move <br>: the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR <br>: Name as number 6 on the list.<p>: STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as <br>: close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at <br>: least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All <br>: you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you <br>: make! You won't get very much unless you post like crazy. :)<p>: This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 <br>: Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws.<br>: Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, <br>: you can use it again, and again.<p>: PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the <br>: honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully <br>: adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of <br>: integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many <br>: others have received will come your way.<p>: NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, <br>: either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. <br>: This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might <br>: be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk <br>: of mail theft.)<p>: So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, <br>: six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List <br>: Developer with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list <br>: geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will <br>: be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for <br>: only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the first six people listed above) Send <br>: it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business!<p>: ---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ <p>: Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own <br>: posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and <br>: drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' <br>: from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the <br>: computer's memory.<br>: Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top <br>: of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will <br>: paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name <br>: to the list. Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If <br>: you want to do your postings in different settings, you'll always <br>: have this file to go back to. <br>: Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for <br>: various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, <br>: discussions.)<br>: Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new <br>: message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste <br>: from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that <br>: everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a <br>: particular group, click the post message button. You're done with <br>: your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is <br>: jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of <br>: it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE <br>: MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE! BUT YOU <br>: HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** That's it! You will begin receiving <br>: money from around the world within days! You may eventually want to <br>: rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If <br>: you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as <br>: the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE <br>: CORRECT.** <p><br>: each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 <br>: postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each <br>: of the original 5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each <br>: make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I <br>: will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn <br>: around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 <br>: replies each, I will make an additional $625.00! OK, now here is the <br>: fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with <br>: my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me <br>: $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 <br>: newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 <br>: newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original <br>: investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the <br>: list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send <br>: out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 <br>: again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you <br>: realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the <br>: internet and reading these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are <br>: now!! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think <br>: so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no <br>: one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that <br>: happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest <br>: people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are <br>: willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new <br>: users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual <br>: internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really <br>: work.<p><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>Follow Ups:<p><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>Post a Followup<p>Name: <br>E-Mail: <p>Subject: <p>Comments:<p><p><p><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>Follow Ups:<p><p><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>Post a Followup<p>    Name: <br>E-Mail: <p>Subject: <p>Comments:<br> <p>Optional Link URL: <br>Link Title: <br>Optional Image URL: <p>  <p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>[ Follow Ups ] [ Post Followup ] [ Ticker Tape - Financial News Reports Board ] <br></blockquote><br><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 104--></ul><!--end: 104--><br><H4><a name="postfp">Post a Followup</a></H4><form method=POST action="http://www.audiorom.com/cgi-bin/multi4M.cgi"><input type=hidden name="reply" value="104"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="dw"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="6 dollars turns into 6000 dollars"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="February 17, 1999 at 20:10:7"><input type=hidden name="bb_id" value="general::General"><input type=hidden name="allowTags" value=""><pre>Name:     <input type=text name="name" size=41>E-Mail:   <input type=text name="email" size=41><p>Subject:  <input type=text name="subject" value="Re: 6 dollars turns into 6000 dollars" size=41><p>Message:<br><textarea name="body" COLS=40 ROWS=10></textarea><p align="center"><input type=submit value="Submit Follow Up"> <input type=reset value="Clear"></p><hr size=1 width="75%"><p align="center">[ <a href="msg/104.html#followups">Follow Ups</a> ] [ <a href="msg/104.html#postfp">Post Followup</a> ] [ <a href="index.html">General</a> ] </p><hr size=1 width="75%"><p></body></html>
