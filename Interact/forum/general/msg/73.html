OR MUCH MORE! <br>: READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE! <br>: I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little <br>: While back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, <br>: And came across an article similar to this that said you could make <br>: Thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of <br>: $6.00! So I thought, "Yeah right, this must be a scam", but <br>: Like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said <br>: That you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address stated in the <br>: Article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of <br>: The list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. <br>: (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it <br>: Over and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I <br>: Figured: "what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, <br>: Right?" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!... <br>: Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I <br>: Figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my <br>: First week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had <br>: Made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over <br>: $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I <br>: Have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in <br>: Rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more <br>: Than that on the lottery! Let me tell you how this works and most <br>: Importantly, why it works.... Also, make sure you print a copy of this <br>: Article NOW, so you can get the information off of it, as you need it. <br>: I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you <br>: Will start making more money than you thought possible by doing <br>: Something so easy! <br>: Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (Print it out or <br>: Download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! <br>: It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage) <br>: IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not <br>: Illegal; and it is virtually no risk - it really works! <br>: If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive <br>: Extraordinary dividends. <br>: PLEASE NOTE: <br>: Please follows these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be <br>: Yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of <br>: The honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue its <br>: Success by carefully adhering to the instructions. <br>: You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business <br>: Your product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in <br>: The business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are <br>: Happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made <br>: From the mailing lists is secondary to the income, which is made from <br>: People like you and me asking to be included in that list. <br>: Here are the 4 easy steps to success: <br>: STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on <br>: Each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now <br>: Get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of <br>: Paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent <br>: Thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal <br>: Them MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR ENVELOPES. <br>: You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of <br>: Paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 <br>: Bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY <br>: LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for <br>: It! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried <br>: About the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. <br>: Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed <br>: legal! Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses: <p><br>:#1)	Lachlan Inglis<br>	PO Box 47<br>	Tiaro<br>	QLD, 4650<br>	Australia <p>:#2)	Keith Nelson<br>	1 Bel Air Dr.<br>	Rhinebeck, NY 12572<br>	USA <p>:#3)	Nathan VanVickle<br> 	1106 Cedar St.<br> 	LaGrande OR 97850<p>:#4)	Derrick Seitz<br> 	508 Sunset<br> 	LaGrande OR 97850<p>.#5)	Matt Smith<br>                P.O. Box 613<br>                Eden UT 84310<p>.#6)	Jason Iron Moccasin <br>	5540 Araby Place<br>	Indian Head MD 20640<p>: STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move <br>: the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR <br>: Name as number 6 on the list. <br>: STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as <br>: close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at <br>: least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All <br>: you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! <br>: ** EVERYBODY AROUND THE WORLD CAN DO IT, BUT REMEMBER TO<br>: PUT ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR EVELOPES!!!!**<br>: This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 <br>: Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws.<br>: Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, <br>: you can use it again, and again. <br>: PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the <br>: honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully <br>: adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of <br>: integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many <br>: others have received will come your way. <br>: NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, <br>: either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. <br>: This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might <br>: be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk <br>: of mail theft.) <br>: So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, <br>: six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List <br>: Developer with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list <br>: geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will <br>: be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for <br>: only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the first six people listed above) Send <br>: it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business! <br>: ---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ <br>: Step 1) you do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own <br>: posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and <br>: drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' <br>: from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the <br>: computer's memory. <br>: Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top <br>: of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will <br>: paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name <br>: to the list. <br>: Step 3) save your new notepad file as a .text file. If <br>: you want to do your postings in different settings, you'll always <br>: have this file to go back to. <br>: Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for <br>: various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) <br>: Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as anew <br>: message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste <br>: from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that <br>: everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a <br>: particular group, click the post message button. You're done with <br>: your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is <br>: jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of <br>: it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! <br>: **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN (Massage-boards etc.) <br>: THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200 <br>: That's it! You will begin receiving <br>: money from around the world within days! You may eventually want to <br>: rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If <br>: you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as <br>: the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** <br>: Now the WHY part: <br>: Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low <br>: example). So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now, <br>: each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 <br>: postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each <br>: of the original 5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each <br>: make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I <br>: will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn <br>: around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 <br>: replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the <br>: fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with <br>: my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies that just made me <br>: $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 <br>: newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 <br>: newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original <br>: investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the <br>: list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send <br>: out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 <br>: again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you <br>: realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the <br>: Internet and reading these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are <br>: now!! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think <br>: so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no <br>: one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that <br>: happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest <br>: people who are joining the Internet and newsgroups everyday and are <br>: willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new <br>: users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual <br>: Internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really <br>: work. Don't let this exciting opportunity pass you by!<br></blockquote><br><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 73--><!--top: 114--><li><a href="msg/114.html">Earn easy money</a> <b>Mikey Workz</b> <i>5/31/99 21:20:41</i>(<!--responses: 114-->0)<ul><!--insert: 114--></ul><!--end: 114--></ul><!--end: 73--><br><H4><a name="postfp">Post a Followup</a></H4><form method=POST action="http://www.audiorom.com/cgi-bin/multi4M.cgi"><input type=hidden name="reply" value="73"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Jason "><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Turn $6 into $6,000, Please read on for your own sake"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="September 26, 1998 at 16:26:18"><input type=hidden name="bb_id" value="general::General"><input type=hidden name="allowTags" value=""><pre>Name:     <input type=text name="name" size=41>E-Mail:   <input type=text name="email" size=41><p>Subject:  <input type=text name="subject" value="Re: Turn $6 into $6,000, Please read on for your own sake" size=41><p>Message:<br><textarea name="body" COLS=40 ROWS=10></textarea><p align="center"><input type=submit value="Submit Follow Up"> <input type=reset value="Clear"></p><hr size=4 width="75%"><p align="center">[ <a href="msg/73.html#followups">Follow Ups</a> ] [ <a href="msg/73.html#postfp">Post Followup</a> ] [ <a href="index.html">General</a> ] </p><hr size=4 width="75%"><p></body></html>
