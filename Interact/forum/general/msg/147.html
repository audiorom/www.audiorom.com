THIS REALLY CAN MAKE YOU EASY MONEY!! IT WORKS!!! BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW IT TO A LETTER FOR IT TO WORK!!!! <p>A little while back, I was browsing through a newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought," Yeah, right, this must be a scam", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send $1.00US to each of the 6 names and addresses stated in the article. You then place your own name and address on the bottom of the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups (there are thousands). No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured, 'what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, right?' Like most of us, I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! <br>Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT? Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the lottery!! <br>Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works.... also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the required information from it. A cousin of mine did this a few months back, and he is now enjoying life in his brand new Tahoe Sport!! ($30,000+). So it does work!! <br>STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope to prevent thievery. Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service by this. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses: <br>#1) R. Hernandez 12 Van Orden Avenue Spring Valley, NY  10977 <br>#2) D. Campney 5 Broadway Cornwall, NY  12518<br>#3) A. Battiato PO Box 569 Chester, NY  10918<br>#4) D. Montroy 6 Normandy Village #8 Nanuet, NY  10954 <br>#5) K. Lehan 206 W. Central Avenue Pearl River, NY  10965<br>#6) J. Correa 36 Ayres Court Circleville, NY  10913 <br>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list. <br>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! <br>---DIRECTIONS -----HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ <br>Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory. <br>Step 2) Open a blank "notepad" file under accessories in windows and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. <br>Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings in different sittings, you'll always have this file to go back to. <br>Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) <br>Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're done with your first one! <br>Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** <br>Now the WHY part: Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example). So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is, do you realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will work. <p><br></blockquote><br><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 147--></ul><!--end: 147--><br><H4><a name="postfp">Post a Followup</a></H4><form method=POST action="http://www.audiorom.com/cgi-bin/multi4M.cgi"><input type=hidden name="reply" value="147"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Lee"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="How to Make Money"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="September 30, 1999 at 14:52:22"><input type=hidden name="bb_id" value="general::General"><input type=hidden name="allowTags" value=""><pre>Name:     <input type=text name="name" size=41>E-Mail:   <input type=text name="email" size=41><p>Subject:  <input type=text name="subject" value="Re: How to Make Money" size=41><p>Message:<br><textarea name="body" COLS=40 ROWS=10></textarea><p align="center"><input type=submit value="Submit Follow Up"> <input type=reset value="Clear"></p><hr size=1 width="75%"><p align="center">[ <a href="msg/147.html#followups">Follow Ups</a> ] [ <a href="msg/147.html#postfp">Post Followup</a> ] [ <a href="index.html">General</a> ] </p><hr size=1 width="75%"><p></body></html>
