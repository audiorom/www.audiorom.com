LOTS OF CASH, FAST AND COMPLETELY LEGAL, <br>THIS REALLY WORKS!!<br>THIS REALLY CAN MAKE YOU EASY MONEY!! IT WORKS!!!<br>BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW IT TO A LETTER FOR IT TO WORK!!!! I know<br>that this is a long letter but it only takes a few minutes to read<br>and it could change your life!!!!<br>A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, <br>just like you are now, and came across an article similar to <br>this that said you could make thousands of dollars within <br>weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00!<br>So I thought," Yeah, right, this must be a scam", <br>but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading.<br>Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of <br>the 6 names and address stated in the article. You then place<br>your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #6, <br>and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are<br>thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it <br>over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying <br>it. <br>I figured what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, <br>right? Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little<br>worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it <br>out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they<br>confirmed that it is indeed legal! Then I invested the <br>measly $6.00.  You should try it too. It's easy, and it works.<br>  Let me tell you how this works and most<br>importantly, why it works....also, make sure you print a <br>copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of<br>it as you need it. <br>STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following <br>on each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING<br>LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH <br>of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen <br>through the envelope to prevent thievery. <br>Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal <br>them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with <br>a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and <br>address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating <br>a service by this. <br>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! <br>Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses: <br>#1)Trina, 5212 Coach Drive, Richmond, CA 94803<br>#2)Turner Brown, 24 Andrew Lane * Lansdale, PA * 19446<br>#3) Jerry Lacson, 1535 M. Adriatico St. ( SMC ) Malate,<br>Manila ,Phillipines Zip 1000<br>#4)Thomas Mac, 415 Gayley Ave . #112 Los Angeles, CA 90024<br>#5)Ronnie Krishna, P.O.Box 30535, Nairobi, Kenya.<br>#6)Jana Barron, 2204 Old Magnolia Rd.Conroe,Tx.77304<p>STEP 2: MOST IMPORTANT! You MUST take the #1 name off the list that you see<br>above, <br>move the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) <br>and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list. STEP 3: Change<br>anything you need to, but try to keep this article as <br>close to original as possible. Now, post your amended <br>article to at least 200 newsgroups. <br>(I think there are close to 24,000 groups) <br>All you need is 200, but remember, the more you<br>post, the more money you make! <p>DIRECTIONS ---HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS <p>Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your<br>own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of <br>this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this <br>document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. <br>This will copy the entire letter into the computers memory. <p>Step 2) Open a blank "notepad" file under accessories in windows <br>and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. <br>From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste <br>a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add <br>your name to the list. <p>Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want <br>to do your postings in different sittings, you'll always <br>have this file to go back to. <p>Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching<br>for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, <br>chat sites, discussions.) <p>Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as <br>a new message by highlighting the text of this letter <br>and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in<br>the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees <br>as they scroll through the list of postings in a <br>particular group,click the post message button. <p>You're done with your first one! <br>Congratulations...THAT'S IT! <br>All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, <br>after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds <br>for each newsgroup! <br>**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, <br>THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! <br>BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200**<br>That's it! <p>You will begin receiving money from around the world within days!After you post 200 of course! <br>You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount <br>of mail you will receive. <br>If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, <br>as long as the postman will deliver it. <br>**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** <p>Now the WHY part: <p>Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies <br>(a very low example). So then I make $5.00 with my name at #6 <br>on the letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me <br>$1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5 <br>and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is <br>another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM <br>posts with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring <br>in an additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and<br>post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 <br>replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK,<br>now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a <br>MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each<br>only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! <br>Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200<br>newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per <br>200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With a<br>original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name <br>is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting<br>in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on <br>the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start<br>posting again. The thing to remember is, do you realize <br>that thousands of people all over the world are joining the<br>internet and reading these articles everyday, <p>JUST LIKE YOU are now!!<p><p>YOU MUST BE HONEST!!</blockquote><br><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 142--></ul><!--end: 142--><br><H4><a name="postfp">Post a Followup</a></H4><form method=POST action="http://www.audiorom.com/cgi-bin/multi4M.cgi"><input type=hidden name="reply" value="1,142"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="jana"><input type=hidden name="origemail" value="janabarron@hotmail.com"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="From $6 to $6000.00!!
