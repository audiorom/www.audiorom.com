A little<br>while back, I was browsing through newsgroups,<br>just like you are now, and came across an article similar to<br>this that said you could make thousands of $$$<br>within weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00! So I<br>thought, "Yeah right, this must be a scam", but like<br>most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said<br>that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and<br>addresses stated in the article. You then place your own name and<br>address in the bottom of the list at #6, and<br>post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are<br>thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over,<br>and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I<br>figured: "what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00<br>right?" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS<br>WHAT!?... within 7 days, I started getting<br>$$$ in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon,<br>but the $$$ just kept coming in. In my first<br>week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had<br>made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third<br>week I had over $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now<br>my fourth week and I have made a total of just<br>over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly<br>worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than<br>that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most<br>importantly, WHY it works...also, make sure you<br>print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information<br>off of it as you need it.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Here are the 4 easy steps to success:<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following<br>on each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now<br>get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH<br>of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through<br>the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one<br>paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now<br>have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece<br>of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a<br>$1.00 bill.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>WHAT MAKES THIS LEGAL??<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business<br>your product is a service. You are in the business of developing<br>Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks<br>for quality lists. However, the $$$ made from the mailing lists<br>is nothing compared to the income which is made from people like you<br>and me asking to be included in that list.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!<br>You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it!<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about<br>the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with<br>the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it<br>is indeed legal. If you have any doubts, refer to<br>Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<p>#1) Blake Marsden<br>288 Royal Oak ct.,<br>Oakville, Ont.<br>L6H 3A8<p>#2) Timothy Johnson<br> 5549 Hall Ave.<br>Corpus Christi, TX<br>78408<p>#3) M.

Gaiven<br>   114 Oleander<br>   Lake Jackson, TX 77566<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above,<br>move the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and<br>add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this<br>article as close to original as possible. Now,<br>post your amended article to at least 200<br>newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you<br>need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more $$$ you<br>make! ITS THAT EASY!!<br>HERE ARE DIRECTIONS FOR HOW TO POST<br>TO NEWSGROUPS:<br>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>Step 1) You do not need to re-type this<br>entire letter to do your own posting. Simply<br>put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your<br>cursor to the bottom of this document, and select<br>'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter<br>into the computer's memory.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor<br>at the top of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select<br>'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad<br>so that you can add your name to the list.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you<br>want to do your postings in different settings, you'll always<br>have this file to go back to.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet Explorer and try<br>searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums,<br>message boards, chat sites, discussions).<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article<br>as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter<br>and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this<br>will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the<br>list of postings in a particular group, click the<br>post message button. You're done with your first one!<br>Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump<br>to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of<br>it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup!<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN,<br>THE MORE $$$ YOU WILL MAKE!<br>BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200**<br>====================================================================<br>That's it! You will begin receiving $$$ from<br>around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a<br>P.O. Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive.<br>If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a<br>name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it.<br>**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.**<br>Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make<br>the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5<br>and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is<br>another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts<br>with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an<br>additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post<br>the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each,<br>I will make an additional $625.00!<br>====================================================================<br>OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a<br>MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they<br>each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!!<br>Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message<br>to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per<br>200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00!<br>With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING!<br>When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the<br>latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to<br>names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again.<br>And start posting again.<br>====================================================================<br>The thing to remember is that thousands of people all over the<br>world are joining the internet and reading these articles<br>everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $6.00 and<br>see if it really works?? I think so... People have said,<br>"what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the $$$?<br>So what!<br>What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of<br>new honest users and new honest people who are joining the<br>internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a<br>try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day,<br>with thousands of those joining the actual internet.<br>********************************************************************<br>Keep a copy of these steps for<br>yourself and, whenever you need $$$, you can use it again, and<br>again.
