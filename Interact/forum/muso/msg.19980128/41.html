Beginning Thursday and running through 12 November, <br>the theme of this year's festival, "possible hybrids between <br>traditional and contemporary musics," is one close to Hassell's <br>heart. <p>For decades, Hassell has been developing a philosophy of both <br>playing and composing that he calls "fourth world," which he <br>says is "a term to describe the possibility of music in global <br>terms - beyond First World, beyond Third World, beyond <br>classical, beyond pop." He's described fourth world as an <br>ideal blend of traditional music from around the world with <br>Western forms and modern electronics, forming a kind of <br>contemporary folk music from "unknown and imaginary regions."<p>Since the 1979 release of Vernal Equinox, his first solo album, <br>Hassell has been morphing sounds, song-writing techniques, and <br>musical theory, blending old and new musics, trying never to <br>lose the essence of either. On albums such as Earthquake Island, <br>Dream Theory in Malay, and Power Spot you can hear subtle <br>experiments with and combinations of raga, gamelan, and pygmy <br>vocal styles mixed with 20th-century Western classical composing <br>techniques. More recently, Hassell has turned the fourth world <br>eye back on modern America, transmuting club hip hop into <br>something otherworldly on his album Dressing for Pleasure. <p>At the Manca fest, along with discussing the possibilities of new <br>musical forms, Hassell will speak on what he calls the "banalization <br>of the exotic." This is the inevitable result, he argues, of "world <br>music" becoming a mass-market form for big music labels. The <br>banalization he speaks about covers both the corporate search for <br>new forms to toss to a sensation-hungry public and a dumbing-down <br>of other musical forms, such as the Western record company practice <br>of bringing, for example, black African and Algerian pop musicians <br>into the studio, not with their own bands, but with generic session <br>musicians to tone down their styles and theoretically make them <br>more marketable to a Western audience. <p>Hassell's work reflects the opposite approach to creating music. <br>Instead of trying to guess what the public will want next, he records <br>exactly what fascinates him at the time. This means that his sound <br>has shifted over the years, yet retains a solid center. If you <br>listen to his 1983 album Aka-Darbari-Java, you'll hear the classic <br>early Hassell sound. The piece "Darbari Extension" is a sonic that <br>he describes in the album's liner notes: "A trumpet, branched into <br>a chorus of trumpets by computer, traces the motifs of the Indian <br>raga 'Darbari' over Senegalese drumming recorded in Paris and a <br>background mosaic of frozen moments from an exotic Hollywood <br>orchestration of the 1950s...." <p>Ironically, Hassell's own search through various musical styles <br>and disciplines - which included time both in India studying raga <br>with master singer Pandit Pran Nath and in Germany studying with <br>composer Karlheinz Stockhausen - has led him back to where he <br>started: playing acoustic trumpet with no electronics and no <br>effects. Hassell has spent more than 20 years tweaking the sound <br>of his horn, playing through effects boxes to create clusters of <br>horns and transform every note into a chord. However, in the past <br>year, while playing sessions with musicians ranging from Seal to <br>Bjork to Ani Difranco to Ry Cooder, he was playing his trumpet <br>without effects. This helped bring Hassell back to a fascination <br>with the horn's naked sound. <p>Hassell has not left electronics behind altogether. This fall, <br>Hassell will perform "Lurch," an evening-length piece originally <br>commissioned by the Netherlands Dance Theater that played last <br>September. "Lurch" is an exercise in what Hassell calls "self-<br>sampling." While Hassell plays an acoustic trumpet during the <br>piece, he's joined onstage by two DJs. The DJs sample and remix <br>portions of Hassell's own albums, while the trumpeter creates <br>new melody and texture lines to accompany the piece. <p>At Manca, Hassell and his new band will perform some acoustic <br>sketches for an upcoming version of "Lurch." A recording of <br>the performance will be issued at the festival, taking the <br>idea of self-sampling one step further into self-bootlegging. <br>The Manca performance will be the first time Hassell has been <br>on stage in Europe in almost 10 years. Hassell and the band <br>will then move on to performances in London and Amsterdam. <p>__________________</blockquote><br><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 41--></ul><!--end: 41--><br><H4><a name="postfp">Post a Followup</a></H4><form method=POST action="http://www.audiorom.com/cgi-bin/multi4M.cgi"><input type=hidden name="reply" value="41"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="tel"><input type=hidden name="origemail" value="t-madeley@rocketmail.com"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="'Fourth World' music"><input type=hidden name="origdate" value="November 7, 1997 at 11:26:40"><input type=hidden name="bb_id" value="muso::Music"><input type=hidden name="allowTags" value=""><pre>Name:     <input type=text name="name" size=41>E-Mail:   <input type=text name="email" size=41><p>Subject:  <input type=text name="subject" value="Re: 'Fourth World' music" size=41><p>Message:<br><textarea name="body" COLS=40 ROWS=10></textarea><p align="center"><input type=submit value="Submit Follow Up"> <input type=reset value="Clear"></p><hr size=4 width="75%"><p align="center">[ <a href="msg/41.html#followups">Follow Ups</a> ] [ <a href="msg/41.html#postfp">Post Followup</a> ] [ <a href="index.html">Music</a> ] </p><hr size=4 width="75%"><p></body></html>
