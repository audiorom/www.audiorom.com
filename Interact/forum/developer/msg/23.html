I am now in my <br>degree year, doing 'Interactive Media'. <br>It was great to see you are doing such <br>good and interesting work.<br>I have to say that I was amazed that we <br>are both into simular areas of intrest.<br>I have been doing stuff in Director, <br>and would love to have the knowledge of <br>how to use light as a sensor to make music.<br>I need to find out (learn) what software<br>is used in creating conections between <br>sensors, motion sensors or light<br>sensetive, or touch.<br>I don't know what software to use to<br>create a connection between the sensor<br>and the computer.<br>I am fasinated by the type of work you <br>are involved in and have for a year and<br>more sought information on how to set up<br>an instatlation in which sounds are <br>manipulated by people moving within <br>the space. Perhaps you have some <br>sugestions? <br> I hope to do something on this for my<br>end of year show.<br>Andre, I am glad to be in touch with you <br>again. I just hope you are pleased to hear <br>from me also. A lot of water under the<br>bridge. We both are working in music<br>recording etc. Then we both get out of <br>that, to some degree, and we are both<br>involved in interactive work.<br>There is an event coming up here in <br>Dublin, called "Freeze". It might be <br>interesting for you as it could involve <br>your light sensor piece.<br>I will send you info on this.<br>Anyhow great to hear about you.Great to<br>see you doing well.<br>Hope to hear from you,<br>		Peace'n'Love<br>			Tarlach.<br></blockquote><br><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 23--></ul><!--end: 23--><br><H4><a name="postfp">Post a Followup</a></H4><form method=POST action="http://www.audiorom.com/cgi-bin/multi4M.cgi"><input type=hidden name="reply" value="12,15,16,17,18,23"><input type=hidden name="origname" value="Tarlach O'Maolain (Yes, that Tarlach!)"><input type=hidden name="origsubject" value="Re:Greeting to Andre.
