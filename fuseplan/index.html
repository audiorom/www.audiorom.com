Here's a very rough plan of the work. Some images are  of the set up and there is  some text about the works we showed at the ICA which trigger happy was part of. <br>It needs a data projector hanging from the ceiling, which projects down onto the surface of the table.<br>The table surface is about a metre high from the floor. The Projector needs to have about 4 metres from its lense to the surface of the table. <br>We have our own custom built hardware that takes in switch information from the light sensors on the top of the table and converts it for the mac. <br>The signals get split so that both macs get the data from the table.<br> 1 mac is producing all the sound via a midi set up and a few synths and samplers which then gets pumped out to  a small PA. The other mac produces all the images which get projected onto the table.<BR>  email me <A HREF="mailto:andre@audiorom.com">andre@audiorom.com</A>   if you have any questions or email me your telephone number and I shall give you a buzz.<BR> <BR> Thanks, Andre<BR> <BR>  <br><HR><br><br><img src="1.jpg" alt="-" border=0><BR><BR>Kit used <BR><BR><img src="4.jpg" alt="-" border=0><BR><BR>Audio Set up<BR><BR><img src="3.jpg" alt="-" border=0><BR><BR>Circular Rig for speakers (We put this up if there is rigging to hang from else we wont bother)<BR><BR><img src="5.jpg" alt="-" border=0><BR><BR>Trigger Happy with 11 directional speakers for the sound<BR><BR><img src="2.jpg" alt="-" border=0><BR><BR>Trigger Happy Table<BR><BR><img src="6.jpg" alt="-" border=0><BR><BR>View from above showing projector in the riiging and table below<BR>         <BR>  <HR> <BR><H2>Interactive Music - Merging Participation, Architecture and Visuals  throughSound</H2> <BR><BR>The work of AudioRom is indicative of an emergent culture cohering theparticipatory, sculptural and visual through the use of sound and music. Incontrast to a lot of other works located in the visual arts, the music is neverseen as incidental, but is regarded as central to all the pieces whether they arean interactive installation or a CD Rom. Definitively entitling their CD Rom andpractice as Interactive Music, AudioRom take their  sources from artists such asToshio Iwai and Brian Eno. These influences, together with an acknowledgement ofthe more culturally organic shifts in expectation from audiences who are used toclub video projections mixed with music, have enabled AudioRom to create a uniqueand eclectic mix of installation, game and audio visual authoring package.<BR><BR>All the pieces in this exhibition have been constructed as toys or games in thesense of the arcade or console. Each one defines a different formal approach tothe fusion of visuals and music through the use of various interactive devicesand musical styles or samples. In all the installations or games the viewer isencouraged to interact on a multi-user level so that complex layering of soundand visuals can be built up. Although there is an outward appearance of audiencecontrol, the artists are clear in their intention that much of the work ispreauthored and does not rely on random generative systems. The work is filmicand designed to work as a cinematic score with the soundtrack blipping in and outof the movie to define a meaning or even narrative to the work.<BR><BR>Big Bevelled Button  represents a musical interaction which is heavilyintermeshed with the visuals. This is a slow ambient piece demanding  that theaudience make gestural visuals to influence the music played. The visuals definethe sentiment  for the music in this context  with the piece being built up veryslowly.<BR><BR>Hyper Peppy and Big Bevelled Button are both reliant on the gestural mark tocomplete the piece, but Hyper Peppy by contrast does not strictly speaking workon a multi-user level in that each viewer competes to grab the solo tension ofthe mark and music generating machine. Rather like the old Etch- a-Sketch drawingmachines, as one viewer takes over the interactive system, the previous viewer’scomposition is erased and overwritten. However, multi authoring exists in thatviewers can create their own interventions between one another to create acomplex musical and visual exchange. Trigger Happy operates slightly differentlyin that up to eleven viewers can drop in various breaks and samples at their ownchosen points in the track. Rather than creating textures or marks on the visualscreen, the viewers are composing arrangements of sounds which can be switched onor off through the interactive system. Viewers are essentially choosing their owntracks and sequencing them live into the system using a similar approach to a DJ.<BR><BR>Alongside the CD Rom, these installations allow an exploration and development ofinteractivity and engagement with work on a level which pushes the boundaries ofaudience participation. The distinguishing and innovative feature of this work isthe equal emphasis on music and visuals within the overall form of the work.AudioRom are setting a new precedent as field leaders for the development ofintegrated music and visuals within interactive multi-media.<BR><BR>Helen Sloan, Curator for AudioRom Show ICA 1998  <BR><BR><BR><BR>                        </body></html>
