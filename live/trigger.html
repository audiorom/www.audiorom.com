Viewers areessentially choosing their own tracks and sequencing them live into thesystem using a similar approach to a DJ / VJ.<BR><BR>Trigger Happy has last  been  shown  at Kunst+Technik in <A HREF="../news/berlin.html">Berlin</A>  in September.<BR><BR><A HREF="install.html"><IMG SRC="../images/back.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="31" BORDER="0"></A> </FONT></TD> </TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
