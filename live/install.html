The distinguishing and innovativefeature of this work is the equal emphasis on music and visuals within theoverall form of the work.</P><P>AudioRom are setting a new precedent as field leaders for the developmentof integrated music and visuals within interactive multi-media.AudioRom's most recent installation works  are table based, reminiscent ofthe arcade or console. Each one defines a different formal approach to thefusion of visuals and music through the use of various sensory interactivedevices and musical styles or samples. In all the installations or gamesthe viewer is encouraged to interact on a multi-user level so that complexlayering of sound and visuals can be built up.The audience is invited to interact and explore their own aestheticperceptions of the music and graphics by playing, effecting, remixing andcreating gestural movements within light or sensory spaces.</P></FONT></TD> </TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
