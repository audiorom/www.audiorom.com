To make a successful OMexperience, one which incorporates the range of media available (text, graphics,animation, video, sound, music), not only requires the skills of particularpractitioners, but also needs the solid structure of code to synthesise the aimsof the overarching concept. Sometimes the concept over reaches what isdeliverable, sometimes the content is enslaved by the parameters of theprogramming. Collaboration is key. And collaboration has extended from productionteams to include musicians and visual artists, lifting CDROM entertainment fromthe games stores and reference libraries into the art house.&#34;<p>&#34;Take AudioRom as an example. These digital citizens declare themselves to be agroup with a line-up of guitar, bass, drums, computers, animatronics and digitalvideo. Their AudioRom is simple in concept: an enhanced CD with the interactiveelements being a collection of musically explorative games. There is no aim tothe games other than to create interesting aural and visual experiences, fromsplattering colours over the screen, which then respond with sound when the mouseis rolled over them, to musical ping-pong and &#34;Lyric Generator&#34;, where the userkeys in words to be spat out at random. The interface is highly original; a mousemovement spins you off in the given direction that seems to stretch on withoutlimit. Usually, you feel uninhibited by the parameters of the screen. The soundquality on this ROM, which is currently at a demo stage, is fine, and the music -drum &#39;n&#39; bass mostly - is good.&#34;<br><P><A HREF="plin.html"><FONT SIZE=-1>Press Directory</FONT></A></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
