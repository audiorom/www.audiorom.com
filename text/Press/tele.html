Theplayful intuitive interfaces are reminiscent of multimedia design for children.&#34;What interests us is that it&#39;s engaging rather than simply entertaining.&#34;Audiorom's next move is away from the screens and into the clubs. They playtogether as a live band, and are rehearsing a set that involves audienceinteraction through motion capture video cameras.&#34;.</blockquote><P><A HREF="plin.html"><FONT SIZE=-1>Press Directory</FONT></A>   </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER> </BODY></HTML>
