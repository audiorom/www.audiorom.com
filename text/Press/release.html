But put the same CD into a PC or Mac, click onto any of the shifting AudioRom icons and you access one of 14 different stylised graphic playscapes. Without the need of musical or digital knowledge, you now become the artistic musician and can remix the inetractive sounds, text and graphics on screen to create your own unique visual soundscapes.<p>Click into Audio Painter and create a multicolored landscape from a palette where each colour has it's own attached sound. Run the cursor over the colours and your artwork becomes a musical painting. Or discover AudioKeys where each letter on your keyboard becomes a percussive, rhythmic or big ambient string sound. Type a sentence and your words instantly become multi-layered music played over the Audio Keys backing track.<p>AudioRom's visuals have been created  by internationally renowned graphic designer Neville Brody's Research Studios. Each new music sequence created in Audio Painter, Audio Keys or any of the other 12 audio-visual playscapes can be saved and replayed as your unique audio-visual composition.<p>The Rom and the interactive installations  will be previewing on Monday 2nd February 1998 in the ICA bar and theatre, The Mall, London SW1 from 8 onwards    and during ICA opening times from 16-19 March at the AudioRom CD launch.<p>AudioRom will also be touring their live performances and installations during 1998 at both national and international music and digital arts festivals and will be show casing their work in the first ever New Media Tent.<p>For further information, press pack and images, <A HREF="mailto:info@audiorom.com">e-mail us</A>.</font><p><A HREF="plin.html"><FONT SIZE=-1>Press Directory</FONT></A>   </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
