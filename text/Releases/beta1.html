Beta 1 is an experiment in "systems and visualrepresentation for music multimedia".In other words, how to play with music on aCD Rom.<P>Beta 1 consists of 3 audio tracks that can be played on any standard CDplayer. We then offer up component parts of the audio material within musicalsystems so the player can arrange, mix and play.<P> We still have a small number ofROM's to give out as part of the beta test, so if you are interested in takingpart please <A HREF="mailto:elise@audiorom.com"><FONT SIZE=-1>E-mail</FONT></A> us at audiorom.<P> We would like to thank those whohave taken part in the spirit of Beta1 and for all the constructive feedback. Ifyou have any further comments you can <A HREF="mailto:elise@audiorom.com"><FONT SIZE=-1>E-mail</FONT></A> us or use the message board in theinteract area.<P><A HREF="tromb.html"><FONT SIZE=-1>Releases Directory</FONT></A></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
