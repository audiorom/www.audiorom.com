Available for the price of a standard music CD, slide the CD-Rom in your CD player and it's an album playing 6 tracks of new media band AudioRom's post drum and base music beats with guest apearances by leading experimental musicians TPower. But put the same CD into a PC or Mac, click onto any of the shifting AudioRom icons and you access one of 14 different stylised graphic playscapes. Without the need of musical or digital knowledge, you now become the artistic musician and can remix the inetractive sounds, text and graphics on screen to create your own unique visual soundscapes.<p>2 guest tracks by T-Power<br>graphic design by Neville Brody's Research Studios<br><p>Published by Laboratory<br><p>e-mail<A HREF="mailto:petra@audiorom.com"> here </A>stating your name and address to reserve your copy of <br>"Interactive Music" by AudioRom<P><A HREF="tromb.html"TARGET="main"><FONT SIZE=-1>Releases Directory</FONT></A></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
