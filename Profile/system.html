The system has been used for sending information to midi instruments such as samplers; via light sensors, lasers, or any other switching system.</P><P>The hardware has mainly been used for fine art installation and club events, AudioROM will be now appropriating our systems for live events where the audience will be able to participate in the delivery of the audio/visual arrangement.</P><LI><H3>Animatronics</H3><P>Our collective background in telemedia has shown us that the computer should be viewed always as a tool rather than the medium itself. Escaping the confines which the computer represents has eveolved as a key issue for us.</P><P>Using the computer to control animations or lighting is not a new technique. AudioROM however are experimenting with the potential of the audience controlling computers via various sensor technologies, in order to engage with the performance both sensually and musically. </p><p>This process engages with issues of interface as well as performance art,transforming the technology into something which the audience plays with and explores rather than being confronted with and potentially intimidated by.</P><LI><H3>Midi Integration for Multimedia</H3></A>Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)<P>Midi protocol was first introduced in 1983 when musical instrument manufacturers agreed that a standard protocol was necessary in order to prevent the development of proprietary systems and languages, and to allow communication between electronic devices such as keyboards, sequencers, lighting systems, video, and of course computers.</P><P>The protocol is in essence very simple: very small data strings communicate on, off,<LI><H3>Interactive Video Systems</H3></A>awaiting content...<P><A HREF="profile.html"TARGET="main">Profile Directory</A><P></BODY></HTML>
