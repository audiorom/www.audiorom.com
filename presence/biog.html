the traditional disciplines of art, design,computer programming and electronics are gradually eroding as practitionersengage with exploring the parameters of digital tools. Practitionersre-write the tools in order to examine the nature of the tools critically.Many digital artists/designers programme, and/or make electronic-basedinterfaces for, or as their media. Similarly programmers have createdsoftware that can be regarded as pieces of art or design. Digital toolshave amongst many other things facilitated a shift in perceptions of therole of the author and the technician.<P>At the centre of this shift is the necessity, perceived increasingly bydigital media practitioners, to build new tools from the ground up.Practitioners build tools to generate new tools, tools to generate andexpress new content, create content that requires new tools in order to bearticulated  - the process is a feedback-loop. Increasingly for AudioRom,the process of making an interactive work is dependent on pushing theboundaries of the tools in order to explore the aesthetics and meaningsthat such an interrogation engenders. As AudioRom's media becomes moresophisticated in terms of its requirements - for example, the need in aninteractive installation to process and relate a series of optical userinteractions to a high speed response of audio and visual feedback - thedemands on the existing software infrastructure may become too great.Consequently, AudioRom programmers have to build new processing engines tomeet that particular demand. Often during the development of new tools,previously un-envisioned visual or audio aesthetics may be generated. Theimportance of the issue of a practitioner's control over the tools ofproduction and what it might mean conceptually and artistically, is mostevidenced by an examination of AudioRom's earliest work, the Enhanced CDRom Beta 1.<P>The artistic project Beta 1 (1995), resulted from a period of academicresearch at the University of Westminster by AudioRom Co-Director, andfounding member Andre Ktori. Ktori was interested in exploring therelationship between sound, image and performance in an accessible andengaging form. Beta 1 enabled a user to listen to four specially composedaudio tracks on a CD player - or alternatively create their ownaudio-visual aesthetic experiences on a computer, using a navigablegraphical user interface to engage with 14 different games or toys. Eachgame or toy in Beta 1 created a playful juxtaposition between traditionalmusical representation (i.e. notation) and graphical, textual and painterlyrepresentation of pre-authored musical elements. Utilising these visual andmusical metaphors, the user could play with the music samples, arrangingthem into audio-visual compositions through their engagement with theinterface.<P>Whilst Beta 1 generated a critical response from both industry, and digitalmedia practitioners for its innovative approach to the user's experience ofmusic and visuals as 'graphical musical play' - the parameters andsophistication of its software authorship were apparent. Beta 1'spositioning of the user as an artist or 'co-author' of the highly engagingaesthetic experiences created in each game, facilitated an overwhelmingdesire in the user to make a 'digital artefact'. Appearing within thecontext of the computer's hardware parameters, Beta 1 generated an urgewithin the user to 'save' their audio-visual composition to disk. Unable todo so (only the text game 'Lyric Generator' allowed a field of text to beexported and saved) - through the constrictions imposed by the software'shierarchies and the limits of the programming, a Beta 1 user was left 'alldressed up with nowhere to go'. Ironically then, the factors that made Beta1 so appealing and engaging to a user - experimentation and authorship,were the ones that highlighted the limitations of the experience availablewithin Beta 1.<P>Beta 1 has formed the plexus for the conceptual structure of much of theinteractive digital work AudioRom has produced to date. Sensoryinstallations such as HyperPeppy, Big Bevelled Button and TriggerHappyutilise aspects of Beta 1's audio-visual games combining them withtable-like forms that play on associations with arcade consoles and boardroom tables. Each installation has an optical sensor interface whichfacilitates the multi-user exploration and play with its visual andpre-authored audio content. The Enhanced CD Roms of V-SEQ, SoundTracks andShiftControl expand on Beta 1's authoring models and media. V-SEQ allows auser to input their own content from visual and audio sources in order tobuild their own animations and soundtracks. SoundTracks (presentlyundergoing re-development) allows a user to compose a symphony withpre-authored orchestral samples, alternatively the user may set thesoftware to generative. ShiftControl, Beta 1's most direct progeny andAudioRom's most successful publication commercially, allows a user tocreate, play and save their audio-visual compositions.<P>Through an active engagement with research and the development of newtools, AudioRom have redeveloped, re-articulated and revamped elements ofBeta 1 to create sophisticated and poetic diverse digital media.  ForAudioRom then, as is the case with other digital media practitioners, it isno longer acceptable to compromise artistic ideas as a result of thelimitations of the current tools available. Neither is it acceptable tocompromise the potential for the tools created by digital mediapractitioners, as part of their practice, to become creative systems intheir own right - the notion that the system itself is the art. Such anotion signals a conceptual shift taking place in the discourse of presentdigital media practice. Practitioners are starting to examine the notionthat the creation of tools and machine codes, rather than the content thatthey may generate, is a valid site of artistic expression within digitalmedia.<P>At the time of writing it appears that AudioRom's Tate commissionedinstallation Presence touches on the issues mooted in this text. AudioRom'sPresence is a tool that facilitates the exploration of its aestheticalparameters by its users within the temporal, virtual and geographic contextof the conference. Presence in this sense, can be framed within the contextof the conference as a work-of-process.chelle hughes  - digital media practitioner</font></TD></TR><TR><TD><IMG SRC="images/spacer.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="60"></TD><TD><IMG SRC="images/spacer.gif" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="60"></TD><TD><IMG SRC="images/spacer.gif" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="60"></TD><TD><IMG SRC="images/spacer.gif" WIDTH="380" HEIGHT="60"></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan=4> <img src="images/sponsors.jpg" width=455 height=59 border=0></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
