The vast possibilities of access to<br>highly complex digital facilities have not only re-ignited the vision of producing culture and art democratically, but also sparked a<br>trend of loosening the borders between new compositional science, improvisational music and the sub-cultural style of pop. <p>The exhibition sounds&files brings the rapid development to the point in which PowerBooks and PCs have become the most<br>important instruments for generating electronic sounds. It examines the new forms of expression which were created by conceptually<br>linking soundtrack and film material. At the same time the exhibition questions the fields of popular culture for their specific<br>linguistic styles in which the input of electronic sounds has provided considerable contributions since the beginning of the techno age<br>up to the freely structured styles of the present. <p>First came precursory music festivals in Vienna and other European cities in which this genre was able to achieve undeniable<br>significance far beyond the reaches of just the predisposed scene, as well as similar projects on the internet and most importantly the<br>international rise of Austrian labels whose productions receive regular reviews in acclaimed technical magazines. Now a multitude of<br>snapshots takes a look at the patchwork of cultures which have been and still are being generated around the term "electronic". <p>The starting point of this exhibition project is the enormous potential of the domestic music scene and their<br>self-confident links with design, architecture and art. The cornerstones, however, are provided by internationally renowned musical<br>artists as well as by illustrious production groups which, due to their positioning at other economic centers like England, have<br>succeeded in ingeniously combining a highly commercial advertising language with subversive symbolism. <p>The visual aesthetic of current electronic music is mirrored by the exhibition sounds&files accompanied by a scenery of<br>changing sounds. In the light of these optical-acoustic presentations, the limits between sub-cultural attitudes and mass-cultural<br>currents are to be reassessed. <p>Video and CD-ROM projections only hint to the enormous treasures of visual material which is generated together with the<br>sound production on the computer in the field of electronic music as the borders between simple sound and image processing are<br>becoming more and more fragmented. A narrative sequence of quotes are as much of importance as abstract, virtually generated,<br>psychedelic images in the ambient field or collages of dadaesque image sequences. <p>Numerous labels of electronic music have created a unique design which has long surpassed the initial references to the<br>techno and industrial culture and spawned corporate identities in the micro-cosmos of avant-garde musical currents. Minimalist or<br>flashy explosive typography, computer generated worlds and experimental use of image processing software contribute to the most<br>diverse ways of presentation ranging from extreme austerity to visual overflow. <p>A look at the technical equipment from the very first tube synthesizers produced in a trial-and-error manner to the array of<br>programming languages downloadable from the internet with their specific visualization formats constitute yet another significant<br>aspect of sounds&files. Because of the ongoing redevelopment and advances of digital production techniques, the musical<br>recording procedures and listening behavior are subject to permanent redefinition. Significant electronic musical instruments and<br>documentary material from the early ages of electronic acoustics will be shown in the form of partial flashbacks. <p>A production studio at the center of the exhibition is intended to visualize the generation and the combination of<br>compositional work and live improvisation with electronic sounds under the competent guidance of musicians and theoreticians. <p>At last, a peek into the do-it-yourself world of home studios rounds off the spectrum of the exhibition sounds&files; home<br>studios were chosen because they are indispensable in todayâs music scene but they also resemble primitive home assembly kits<br>compared to the technical possibilities of the 21st century. <p>Overall, sounds&files offers the opportunity to experience electronic music of the present and its cultural fields in the form of<br>video and CD-ROM projections, photo documentaries and installations combined with a review on important historical instruments<br>and a vanguard studio situation. <p>This exhibit on Hearing and Seeing intends to be a project in motion whose character will keep changing continuously, inviting<br>people to stay and come again. A veritable flood of flyers and numerous related magazines will be distributed and a shop with an<br>appropriate assortment of sound recordings, books, goodies and gadgets is also an essential part of sounds&files. <p>Parallel to the exhibition a corresponding sounds&files-homepage will be created to continuously make new information, text<br>material and links on this topic available to everybody. Throughout the exhibition period, sounds will be available in MP3<br>format to establish proper links to the exterior. </blockquote><br><HR align=left width="75%"><p><a name="followups">Follow Ups:</a><br><ul><!--insert: 71--></ul><!--end: 71--><br><HR><a href="index.html"><IMG SRC="/images/back.gif" width=31 height=31 border=0></A>	</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></FORM>  </BODY></HTML>
